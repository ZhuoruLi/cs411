## Project Summary
	This project is a course rating  forum which will include ratings of computer science courses in uiuc and student
	comet of the course. Our application is also an “advisor”, there will also be more information about the courses 
	that can help students understand what they can gain from this course.
	We want to do something unique that can help cs students in UIUC. We are faithful to increase the experience of
	studying a uiuc cs course. The key idea is students help students. Students can get the information of the professor 
	and know how the professor teaches and how other students rate the professor.
